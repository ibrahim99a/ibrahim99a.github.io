<p>My name is Ibrahim Ali and I am currently in my 2nd year studying Computer Science (with Artificial Intelligence) at Brunel University. I selected this course to challenge my own self by engrossing myself into a field which I have had no prior education/learning in. I had personally witnessed the incredible growth and expansion within Technology but wanted to refine and reshape my knowledge and skillset - where Computer Science felt the most natural choice in this.
Although Iâ€™m due to graduate next year, I consider myself a â€˜forever student,â€™ as not only am I eager to both constantly build on my academic foundations and keep up to date with the latest software but, I am also always looking for new things to learn and get into both professionally and for general fun!</p>

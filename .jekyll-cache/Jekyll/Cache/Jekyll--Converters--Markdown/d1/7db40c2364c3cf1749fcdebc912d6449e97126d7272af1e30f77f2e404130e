I"¢<h2>Introduction to My Final Year Project</h2>
<blockquote>
High price fluctuation and unstructured trends are inherent characteristics of the Bitcoin
market, which has grown exponentially in recent years. With this recent growth, Quantitative
Crypto hedge funds have been increasing, where the requirement for a robust forecast model
can assist with trading Bitcoin.
<blockquote>
The purpose of this project is to develop and optimise a deep learning Long short-term
memory(LSTM) neural network that can train on historical time-series data so that it can
forecast future prices. With advancements in data mining, machine learning models have
been implemented previously to capture the seasonality and volatility of Bitcoin. Previous
studies have been conducted that compare different forecast models, where it was concluded
that the LSTM neural network can capture the long term dependencies and unstructured
trend.
<blockquote>
Very few studies focus on optimising a deep learning LSTM model for forecasting so that a
trade can be executed from the results. Due to limitations in the available software at the
time, previous studies could not extract Bitcoin data directly from a Cryptocurrency
Exchange or train the model on a large dataset. This presents a novelty within the project as
over 3 million data samples are extracted and prepared for training the LSTM neural
network. The optimal model is selected based on the lowest root mean squared error
(RMSE).
<blockquote>
The Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology has been
adapted to fit the workflow of this project. The Final LSTM model compiles with a temporal
window size of â€˜5â€™ with 2 â€˜stackedâ€™ hidden layers to produce the best model with a RMSE score
of 2299. This model was then deployed and forecasted future 5 days of price data, where a 5-
day Short swing trade is deployed resulting in a +9.31% Return on Equity.</blockquote>
